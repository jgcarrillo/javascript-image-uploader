### ✨ Explanation

This project was created with the aim of improve my **JavaScript vanilla** skills and also to try the possibility of upload an image and download it again with some changes without any server.

The usage is quite simple: you only need to upload a photo and the web set a **custom background by default** as well as some styles such as border or shadows within the canvas.

Once the image has been uploaded, a preview of the resulting image will appears. The final step is to click on the _Download image_ button.

### 🎨 Customization and features

Due to this is a personal project and a little MVP to show the capabilities of JavaScript, there are **some features** that hasn't been added such as:

-   Select a custom background.
-   Select between different border options.
-   Choose a transparent background.
-   Explore the possiblities of different image extensions (jpeg, png, etc.).

At the moment, you only are able to upload an image and download it again with a custom background by default.

### 🚀 Usage

### 🚩 Issues

During the development I found such a different issues related with works with canvas in JavaScript. Some are the following:

-   You cannot **render CSS** within the canvas, so you only are able to set styles by applying the canvas properties such as strokes, shadows or paths. For this reason, the possibilities are limitated.

-   I haven't been able to set a **proportional image** size for the resulting image, so I had to set manually the image size by myself.

-   The **image doesn't scale proportionally** to the final image, so in some images the result image will probably be quite distorsionated.

-   I have tried to set the uploaded image into the **Local Storage** but I couldn't.

If I have some time, most of those problems would be resolved.
